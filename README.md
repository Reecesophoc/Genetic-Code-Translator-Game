# Genetic Code Translator Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ§¬

An interactive browser-based game for learning how to translate mRNA sequences into proteins.  
Designed for students studying genetics and molecular biology, this game provides two difficulty levels and immediate feedback to help reinforce learning.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Two Difficulty Levels**
  - **Beginner**: Start codon (AUG) highlighted, reading frame shown.
  - **Advanced**: No hints â€” identify start and stop codons yourself.
- **Randomised Sequences**  
  Each game generates a unique mRNA sequence with randomised 5â€² and 3â€² UTRs.
- **Per-Codon Feedback**  
  See which codons you translated correctly after submitting your answer.
- **Scoring & Feedback Messages**  
  Get percentage accuracy and constructive feedback.
- **Codon Helper Tool**  
  Handy reference table of all codons, start/stop markers, and amino acids.
- **Built-in Tutorial**  
  Walkthrough guide for new players â€” optional to skip or replay anytime.
- **Feedback Prompt**  
  Integrated link to leave quick feedback via Qualtrics (takes ~10 seconds).

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Play

1. **Choose Difficulty**: Beginner or Advanced.
2. **Set Peptide Length** (3â€“12 amino acids, start codon included, stop codon excluded).
3. **Translate the mRNA**:  
   - Enter the protein sequence in **one-letter amino acid codes** (no stop codon).
   - Beginner mode will show the reading frame for guidance.
4. **Submit Your Answer**:  
   - After submission, view per-codon feedback and your score.
   - Missing amino acids will leave the codon/answer blank.
5. **Try Again**:  
   - Generate a new sequence or replay to improve your score.
